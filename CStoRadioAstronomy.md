#The applications of compressive sensing/sampling (CS) to radio astronomy

# Introduction #
We have developed some applications of CS to radio astronomy such as image deconvolution, Faraday rotation measure synthesis, multi-frequencies synthesis, etc. Relevant Matlab codes are provided here http://code.google.com/p/csra
